# Explore-Weather-Trends
In this project, the objective was to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperatures trends where I live to overall global temperatures trends. A write up was prepared describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. 
*	Extracted the data from the database by writing SQL queries and exported it to a CSV file. 
*	Created a line chart that compared my city temperatures with the global temperatures by using Python visualization techniques to help user and reviewer understand the significance of data.
*	Calculated and visualized the moving average rather than the yearly averages to smooth out the lines and make trends more observable.

**The observations here reflected that:**
*	My city is hotter on average compared to the global average. 
*	My city temperatures increased while the global temperatures do it as well.
*	The world is getting hotter and over the last few hundred years it been consistent.
